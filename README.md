**Web Development for Crime Tracker**

**Project Overview**
This project is a crime tracking application designed and developed using Ruby on Rails with an MVC architecture and a React front-end. The project included creating unit tests for MVC components and thoroughly testing the application with fabricated datasets to ensure accuracy and performance.

**Technologies Used**
1. Ruby on Rails (MVC architecture): For building the back-end and managing server-side logic.
2. React: To create a dynamic and responsive user interface for the front-end.
3. Unit Testing: Developed unit tests for the MVC components, ensuring that the system behaves as expected.
4. Fabricated Datasets: Used custom data to simulate crime data and test the application's core functionality.

**Key Features**
1. MVC Design Pattern: The application is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, promoting separation of concerns for easier maintenance and scalability.
2. React Front-End: A dynamic, user-friendly interface built using React, providing an interactive experience for tracking crime statistics.
3. Testing: Comprehensive testing using fabricated datasets, along with unit tests for individual MVC components to ensure robustness and reliability.
